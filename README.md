# mlb_dash #
An interactive dashboard for analyzing MLB data using python Dash capabilities.

## Data Sourcing ##
Data is sourced by webscraping the Baseball Reference site with bs4. So far, the app only scrapes and handles team pitching data for the 2020 season. The plan  is for future work to supply team batting and fielding data. 

## Setup ##
To run the app locally, clone the repo and run 'python app.py' in the command line. Follow instructions for directing to local server.

## Analysis ##
The app suppors two-dimensional scatter plots and histogram plots for two variables at a time. More plotting and analysis capabilities will be added in the near 
future.
